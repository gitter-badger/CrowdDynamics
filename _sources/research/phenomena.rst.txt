Phenomena
=========

Egress Congestion
-----------------
When crowd of high density attempt to pass through a `bottleneck`_ exceeding the capacity of the bottleneck and causing a jamming in front of the bottleneck.

Faster is slower
----------------
Phenomena where flow rate through a bottleneck is reduced by agents trying to push harder through. Caused by increased contact forces between rushing agents.

Arching
-------
Formation of arch like structure between agents in front of a bottleneck.

Zipper effect
-------------



Herding
-------
Herding or mass behaviour is phenomena where agents follow the average movement of their nearest neighbors. In nature similar effect occur for example in large crowds of birds flying where individual bird inside a crowd follows eight of its closest neighbors.


Lane formation
--------------
Pedestrians moving into opposite directions organize into lanes.


Freezing by heat
----------------


Turbulence
----------


Stop-and-Go waves
-----------------


Braess's paradox
