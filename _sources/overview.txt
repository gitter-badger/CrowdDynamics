Motivation
----------
This project was created in summer 2016 for Systems Analysis Laboratory (SAL) in Aalto University in Finland. The main goal was to study game theoretical model for egress congestion using existing multi-agent simulation models as a base for creating movement.

Current goals are to improve and generalize multi-agent model and also include cellular automata and continuum flow models.

Crowd Research
--------------
.. Section of talking why crowd simulation model should be developed and where they can be applied to.

Keith still wrote on his thesis

.. epigraph::

   *Crowd Dynamics can be defined as the study of the how and where crowds form and move above the critical density of more than one person per square metre. At high density there is the potential for overcrowding and personal injury.*

   -- *Prof. Dr. G. Keith Still*

We break crowd research down to

.. glossary::

   Crowd Psychology
      How crowd of people behaves.

   Crowd Dynamics
      How crowd of people moves and acts in respect of time.

   Crowd Simulation
      Based on group dynamics and crowd psychology.

   Experimental
      Experimental study of behaviour of crowds. Experimental data serves as a base for simulations.

   Analysis
      Methods for analysing experimental or simulation data.


Applications
------------

Real life applications for crowd research and crowd dynamics are

* Improving safety of buildings, mass events and crowded places in general.
* Evacuation time estimation and understanding evacuation processes
* Venue design and improving the flow rates of the crowd in critical parts. For example busy subways.
* Producing realistic movement in games, animations and virtual reality
